### Installation
To install skirmishbunker directly from GitHub, run the following `pip` command:

	pip install git+https://github.com/medicationforall/skirmishbunker

**OR**

### Local Installation
From the cloned skirmishbunker directory run.

	pip install ./

### Install a development version

If you want to work on this library locally you will need the following instaled globally on you computer:

* Python 3
* setuptools
* pip
* virtualenv (venv)

Next you will need to clone this repo (or, ideally, your own fork):

	git clone https://github.com/medicationforall/skirmishbunker

Now, step into the cloned folder and build a Python virtual environment:

	cd /path/to/skirmishbunker
	python -m venv ./venv

Once this is done, activate the virtual environment and install dependencies:

	source ./venv/bin/activate
	pip install ./

This will take a little while to run, once finished, you might need to link `skirmishbunker` as an editable library (or your changes will not be seen). Do this as follows:

	pip install -e ./

Now edit away!
